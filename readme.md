This is an ecommerce website powered by Django. I am working on empowering the backend and looking for a better frontend framework.

you can download and use this source if you want to because I have also followed instructions and helps along the way. 

Once downloaded,

use python to activate the environment and change the login credentials as you wish. 

Hope this code is useful to all.
